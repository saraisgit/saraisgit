- I’m Sarai, a software developer working primarily in C/C++ at the moment.
- I love OOP, software architecture, and - though my friends laugh at me for it - debugging!
- My biggest project to date is the Smart Home Hub, which I wrote as the final assignment for my training at Experis Academy. As an amalgamation of code I've written throughout the course, some parts are less refined than others - and I'm working on fixing them up.
- I’m currently in search of my first position as a developer, and am excited to broaden my skills and understanding of the field.
